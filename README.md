## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MLB Stats API access
- Twitter API credentials

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLBMatchupXBot.git
cd MLBMatchupXBot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Set up Twitter API credentials in `Xbot/bot.py`
